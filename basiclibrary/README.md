# Basic library

## This is my first java library: Here I have created some basic non-static methods and tests for them
- Added Methods:
  - Roll: takes an int, n, and returns an array of n rolls (nums 1-6);
  - containsDuplicates: takes an array, and returns and boolean value if there are duplicates present
  - calcAverages: takes an array of ints, returns the average of all elements in the array
  - arrayOfArrays: takes a 2D array of ints, returns the array with the lowest average of respective elements
  - findUniqueWeather: no input, returns a string of the min/max temps, and temps that did not exist
  - tally: takes a list, and returns the list element with the highest frequency
